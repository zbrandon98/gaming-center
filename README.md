# Introduction
This program uses a combination of React, TypeScript, Vite, ChakraUI, and RAWG's API (https://rawg.io).
The frontend displays grid of 'gamecards' which contain am image, title, platform, and rating. It also
displays a list of genres on the left and a search bar on top.

The information for the gamecards is fetched from the API. The API is also used to filter and update the
grid. A neat little addition is that when the information is being getched, a skeleton gamecard is 
shown instead of a blank scree, a qol feature.
